# Why "atelier"?

*Atelier* (pronounced **ah-tuh-lee-AY**) is the French word for a workshop.
The name reflects how this tool is intended to be used: a place where work is
shaped iteratively, with humans and tools collaborating closely.

A workshop is not a factory. It values craft over automation, explicit intent
over invisible orchestration, and tools that come and go as the work evolves.

The name is not meant to imply art, magic, or opacity. It is a practical
metaphor for a space where humans and agents work together with clear
boundaries and shared context.
