# Inspiration

Atelier is inspired by the ideas explored in
[*Shipping at Inference Speed*](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed).
The essay argues that traditional Git workflows often add cognitive overhead
that doesn't pay for itself when fast, capable agents are in the loop.

Atelier leans into the parts of that argument that map well to a daily
workflow:

- minimize mental context switches
- evolve codebases linearly when coordination cost is low
- keep agents running continuously while humans intervene intentionally

It treats LLMs as collaborators, not batch tools.

Atelier is not a clone of the essay's workflow. It adapts the underlying
principles to a tool that still supports branch- and review-based paths when
coordination and safety require them.

The goal is to keep work moving without hiding state, intent, or ownership.
