## Intent

Add one operator-facing reference that explains how separate planner, worker, fresh-task recovery, audit, and explicit acceptance tasks coordinate only through native GitHub state and the canonical Git mailbox.

## Rationale

The first v0 dogfood needs a durable, executable lifecycle reference that preserves accountability across task interruption without relying on transcript memory.

## Scope

Add skills/atelier/references/dogfood.md and link it from skills/atelier/SKILL.md.

## Non Goals

Do not change behavior, add automation, add provider mutation code, merge, deploy, close an issue, or include post-v0 #782/#783 work.

## Constraints

Preserve every authority boundary. Add no runtime, provider, daemon, or shared state. Do not claim in the reference that this dogfood run succeeded. Agent Scripts owns implementation. Required validation is exactly just lint and just test.

## Edge Cases

Cover interruption and recovery from a fresh task, stale or unknown evidence that must fail closed, and the distinctions among delivery, operator acceptance, and merge.

## Related Context

Use native GitHub issue #781 and the canonical Git mailbox as durable coordination state; keep the reference consistent with the existing planning, claiming, delegation, audit, host-boundary, mailbox-validation, and Git-mailbox-write references.

## Done Definition

The documentation is exact, executable, operator-facing, and consistent with the existing production planning, claiming, delegation, recovery, audit, and acceptance references.

## Verification Expectations

Run just lint and just test; preserve both results for an independent review of the exact candidate head.

## Review Shape Guidance

Deliver one coherent docs-only pull request.
