<!--
PROJECT.md

Use this file to define project-level agent policies for this Atelier project.
It is optional and fully user-owned.

If a SUCCESS.md file exists inside a workspace, its rules take precedence.
For legacy workspaces, WORKSPACE.md is treated as equivalent.
This PROJECT.md file takes precedence over project-level AGENTS.md.

Atelier does not parse or modify this file.
